# Basic-Matrix-Math

This is my extremly basic implimentation of things I've been learning in my linear Algebra class. This will continue to slowly be updated as I have time. Currently, it has most of the basic vector functionality.

# Next Steps:
1. Matrices
2. Ortho-normalization
3. Image / Kernal of matrices
